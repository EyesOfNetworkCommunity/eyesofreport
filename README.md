# Eyes Of Report : Keep an eye on your application availability ! 

Eyes of report is an open source IT toolbox which provides all the facilities to analyse your application availability regarding service contract defined with users.

To compute application availability, Eyes Of Report centralizes all your equipement monitoring log (from one or several monitoring platform) in its own database. The solution is initially developed to be plugged on nagios based monitoring plateform like Eyes Of Network, Centreon, Shinken...
However connectors can be developed to plug other kind of monitoring solution.

Eyes Of Report can centralize logs and equipments from as much monitoring platform as you want !

Eyes Of report is composed of 4 main bricks :
* Data reception from heterogeneous monitoring solution (logs + equipments) through Docker containers
* ETL for monitoring data historization and consolidate application availability with Pentaho Data Integration community
* Reporting with several out of the box reports immediately available (application availability, outage analysis, COPIL reports...)
* Web interface to manage your contract, your business process, report access and availability computation

Data base management system used is Mariadb (Embedded in Eyes Of report installation)
